Empirical data were collected from the hybrid direct air- and liquid-cooling systems at the Energy System Integration Facility (ESIF) at the High-Performance Computing (HPC) data center located at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. 
Supply temperature, return temperature and cooling power were recorded at a one-minute time step for a 12-month period (September to August) for both the air- and liquid-cooling systems.
